# ðŸŒ˜ Penumbra

Penumbra is a Rust crate and tool for interacting with Mediatek devices.<br>
It provides flashing and readback capabilities, as well as bootloader unlocking and relocking on vulnerable devices.<br>

## Requirements

* On Windows, you'll need to install Mediatek Drivers.
* On Linux you'll need to install `libudev` and add your user to the `dialout` group.

## Usage

Penumbra can be used both as a crate for interacting directly with a device with your own code, as well as providing a (preliminary) [TUI](tui).

For using the crate, use the device API:

```rs
use env_logger::Builder;
use penumbra::Device;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    env_logger::init();
    let da_path = std::path::Path::new("../DA_penangf.bin");
    let da_data = std::fs::read(da_path).expect("Failed to read DA file");

    println!("Searching for MTK port...");
    let mtk_port: SerialPortInfo;
    loop {
        let ports = find_mtk_port();
        if ports.len() > 0 {
            mtk_port = ports[0].clone();
            break;
        }
    }
    println!("Found MTK port: {}", mtk_port.port_name);
    let mut device = Device::init(mtk_port, da_data).expect("Failed to initialize device").await;
    device.set_seccfg_lock_state(LockFlag::Unlock).await

    // Ignore progress for now
    let mut progress = |_read: usize, _total: usize| {};

    let mut lk_a_data = device.read_partition("lk_a", &mut progress).await;

}
```


For using the TUI, first run the executable, then:
* Navigate using the UP and DOWN arrows
* Select the DA in the home page pressing Enter, and select the appropriate file
* After selecting the DA, go on `Enter DA mode` and press `Enter`
* Now connect the device
* Enjoy!

### Debug logs

Penumbra is still in early development, thus it can break auite easily.
If so, you can open an issue attaching debug logs.<br>
To get debug logs, set the environment variabile `RUST_LOG=debug`. A file called `app.log` will be created in thr current directory. 

Note: Penumbra currently only supports MT6768 devices with eMMC (so no UFS for now). Issues reporting incompatibility with other chipset will be ignored until broader support is added.

## Contributing

For contributing, you'll first need to setup a development environment.

If you use Nix, you can just run `nix develop` to enter the development shell.<br>
On any other distribution, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

* libudev-dev
* Rust toolchain
* Rust analyzer
* rustfmt
* glib
* pkg-config
* systemd-dev

### Current Roadmap

Core:
* [ ] Add UFS support
* [ ] Dynamically determine SEJ base (for more chipsets support)
* [ ] Build DA extensions from source
* [ ] Limit extensions only commands when exts are not added to avoid timeouts
* [ ] Add a way to restore state
* [ ] Clean up duplicated code
* [ ] Add support for BROM mode (and setup DRAM)
* [ ] Add support for DA SLA and preloader auth
* [ ] Add target config to Device Info (SBC, DAA and SLA)
* [ ] Improve support for preloader/brom only connection (for testing purposes with just preloader commands)
* [ ] Improve DA parsing and add DA patching

TUI:
* [ ] Add partition read and write (Add partition list next to the action list)
* [ ] Make code reusable (add components like a custom FileExplorer, selectable list...)
* [ ] Change logo with an animated waning crescent moon with blinking stars around
* [ ] Add a switch on the welcome screen to enable or disable logging (with selection for log level)

Scripts:
* [ ] Parse sec policy from both preloader and lk (find a good seclib pattern)

Documentation:
* [ ] Document XFlash protocol
* [ ] Improve Carbonara information

## Learning Resources

Penumbra has [its own documentation](https://shomy.is-a.dev/penumbra), where you can learn more about Mediatek devices and how the Download protocol works.

Other learning resources I suggest are the following
* [mtkclient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient)
* [moto-experiments](https://github.com/R0rt1z2/moto-experiments)
* [kaeru](https://github.com/R0rt1z2/kaeru)
