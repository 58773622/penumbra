# ðŸŒ˜ Penumbra

Penumbra is a Rust crate and tool for interacting with Mediatek devices.<br>
It provides flashing and readback capabilities, as well as bootloader unlocking and relocking on vulnerable devices.<br>

## Requirements

* On Windows, you'll need to install Mediatek Drivers.
* On Linux you'll need to install `libudev` and add your user to the `dialout` group.

## Usage

Penumbra can be used both as a crate for interacting directly with a device with your own code, as well as providing a (preliminary) [TUI](tui).

For using the crate, use the device API:

```rs
use env_logger::Builder;
use penumbra::Device;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    env_logger::init();
    let da_path = std::path::Path::new("../DA_penangf.bin");
    let da_data = std::fs::read(da_path).expect("Failed to read DA file");

    println!("Searching for MTK port...");
    let mtk_port: SerialPortInfo;
    loop {
        let ports = find_mtk_port();
        if ports.len() > 0 {
            mtk_port = ports[0].clone();
            break;
        }
    }
    println!("Found MTK port: {}", mtk_port.port_name);
    let mut device = Device::init(mtk_port, da_data).expect("Failed to initialize device").await;
    device.set_seccfg_lock_state(LockFlag::Unlock).await

    // Ignore progress for now
    let mut progress = |_read: usize, _total: usize| {};

    let mut lk_a_data = device.read_partition("lk_a", &mut progress).await;

}
```


For using the TUI, first run the executable, then:
* Navigate using the UP and DOWN arrows
* Select the DA in the home page pressing Enter, and select the appropriate file
* After selecting the DA, go on `Enter DA mode` and press `Enter`
* Now connect the device
* Enjoy!

## Contributing

For contributing, you'll first need to setup a development environment.

If you use Nix, you can just run `nix develop` to enter the development shell.<br>
On any other distribution, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

* libudev-dev
* Rust toolchain
* Rust analyzer
* rustfmt
* glib
* pkg-config
* systemd-dev

## Learning Resources

Penumbra has [its own documentation](https://shomy.is-a.dev/penumbra), where you can learn more about Mediatek devices and how the Download protocol works.

Other learning resources I suggest are the following
* [mtkclient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient)
* [moto-experiments](https://github.com/R0rt1z2/moto-experiments)
* [kaeru](https://github.com/R0rt1z2/kaeru)
